# Project-1

Proposal: Our project is to understand the trend on opioid deaths in USA from 2011 to 2017. We are achieving this by examining opioid deaths across the states and further exploring demographics of individuals who are dying from opioid use (e.g., income, profession, GDP, unemployment).

Dataset that we will be using: 
https://www.kaggle.com/ryanandreweckberg/opioid-crisis-by-interpersonal-relationships#Wide_Master.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions
(focus on opioid epidemic)



*Analyses to consider for project requirements: aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis.

Hypothesis:
- Do the death rates differ by states? 
    - Null hypothesis: The death rates do not differ by states
    - Alternate hypothesis: The death rates differ by states
- Do the death rates differ by year?
    - Null hypothesis: The death rates do not differ by year
    - Alternate hypothesis: The death rates differ by year
- Do the death rates differ by income?
    - Null hypothesis: The death rates do not differ by income
    - Alternate hypothesis: The death rates differ by income
- Do the death rates differ by unemployment?
    - Null hypothesis: The death rates do not differ by unemployment
    - Alternate hypothesis: The death rates differ by unemployment
- Do the death rates differ by GDP?
    - Null hypothesis: The death rates do not differ by GDP
    - Alternate hypothesis: The death rates differ by GDP


Visualizations:
- Opioid crisis general info and Demographics 
    - Bar graph of specialities that prescribe opioids 
    - Death rate by state: bar graph, boxplot 
    - Death rate by year: line graph
    - Death rate by income: scatterplot and bar graph
    - Death rate by unemployment: scatterplot
    - Scatter plots with linear regression: death rates by income, death rate by unemployment
    - Pie Charts: Education levels within a specific state (top 2 and bottom 2 states based on death rate per capita) 
    - Statistical significance of death vs factor variables: state, year, income, unemployment, GDP
